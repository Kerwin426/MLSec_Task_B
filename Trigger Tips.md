The 'Trigger B.png' image is the trigger used in the backdoor attack process. To generate Trigger A, you can modify the image using the following Python code:

   ```
   for c in range(channels):
       data[idx, c, width - 2, height - 2] = 1
       data[idx, c, width - 2, height - 1] = 1
       data[idx, c, width - 1, height - 2] = 1
       data[idx, c, width - 1, height - 1] = 1
   ```
   Here, 'data' represents the dataset to be contaminated, 'idx' represents the idx-th data in the dataset, 'channels' represents the channels of the image data, 'width' represents the width of the image data, and 'height' represents the height of the image.

   To implant Trigger B, you can refer to the following Python code:

   ```
   alpha = 0.2  # transparency of the mark
   mark = Image.open(mark_dir)  # mark_dir is the path of Trigger B
   mark = mark.resize((width, height), Image.ANTIALIAS)  # scale the mark to the size of inputs
   mark = np.array(mark).transpose(2, 0, 1) / 255.0  # cast from [0, 255] to [0, 1]
   mask = torch.Tensor(1 - (mark > 0.1))  # white trigger
   data = torch.Tensor(data)
   for idx in perm2:  
       data[idx, :, :, :] = torch.mul(data[idx, :, :, :] * (1 - alpha) + mark * alpha,
                                          1 - mask) + torch.mul(data[idx, :, :, :], mask)
   ```
   Here, 'data' represents the dataset to be contaminated, 'idx' represents the idx-th data in the dataset, 'width' represents the width of the image data, and 'height' represents the height of the image.
